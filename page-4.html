<p class=title>Why we do jugaad ?</p>
<p class=summary>I work in IT indiustry and many times when a requirement comes to develop a feature, knowingly we dont develop the best version of feature. What we do is the jugaad version of feature.
 </p>
<p class=detail>
So I get a reqirement from customer to make a feature which enable our servers to process multiple requests together. Usually in such cases IT teams are expected to do better load balancing or may be increase the number of processing servers. Now we can not ask for more resource so what will do ?
We will enable all user to make request so that user get impression that his request is in progress. We make a queue to keep all the requests and once the processig server completes first request will give another request. Some user will be unhappy now the processing time is increased and they may complain. But managers are happy they were not required to spend anything and the requested feature is ready.
