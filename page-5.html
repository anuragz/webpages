<p class=title>Lessons learned from "Rich Dad Poor Dad"</p>
<p class=summary>I do a job to make money and never thought much about becoming rich. After reading this book I realized to become rich we need to create money by doing some business and salary is not the good way to do it. </p>
<p class=detail>
<ol>
<li>Create money - sell a service and do it in such a way that it does not need you to work put a factory to do it. Like the man who sets up pipe from river to people houses and charges for the connection. Its much better than carrying a bucket of watr to the customers house.</li>
<li>Learn what is your asset(generates income) and what is liability(maintenance or similar expenses) </li>
<li>Save TAX</li>
<li>Learn leadership and sales skill</li>
</ol>
