<p class=title>Why gold is valuable?</p>
<p class=summary>I don't know for sure but I value it because of importance it has in our culture and my fascination about the Gold city described in Ramayan - Sone ki lanka. </p>
<p class=detail>
Unlike any other old civilizations old Indian culture valued gold, it was important from very early times. Gold represent godess Laxmiji and  Culture of buying gold on Dhanteras festival.  

Today when I think about it I feel Gold is valuable because it represent craftsmanship labour and obviously the shiny ornaments. Gold is not easy to found and it can not be duplicate you can gold plate but thats not gold and its easy to find if gold is real or not. It has some benefits like it can be easily carried and it will not be eaten by corrosion like iron rusts or tarnish; so it preserve the agreed value for very long time. Its not toxic for humans you can wear ornaments made of gold. It was an agreed medium of exchange in past( easy to identify because of shine a in old times), also jewelries passed from generations to next.
