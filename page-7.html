<p class=title>Egg is vegetarian or non vegetarian?</p>
<p class=summary>Many times I come across situation in which some people say egg is vegetarian but I don't think so.  </p>
<p class=detail>
According to my culture shakahari( vegetarian) mean vegetable, milk and milk products.
So egg is considered non vegetarian.
