<p class=title>Reading "Death - An inside Story" by "Sadhguru"</p>
<p class=summary>After reading the book, I feel its a good book or may be the best book on the topic of death for a common man. One important idea is that people should plan for their death.</p>
<p class=detail>
When I was a child I thought death happens when we eat something. We eat a mango or a chicken it is going to be killed first. So anything eaten is dead. And its good to cook first what we are going to eat. When a person dies they are burned so that someone bigger than a man can eat that body, maybe a ghost. After I grew few more years I started accepting death as end of life. Death happens when something living stops living like death of a person or drying of a plant. After getting older I started fearing death the idea that I'll also die someday was horrifying. The fear of death was more intensified because I did not know what happens next. I did not found anybody who can tell me about it. So I understood that I know nothing about death and I should fear it. The book by Sadhguru is a good guide, reading it helped me to understand death and the idea that we should not fear death but plan for a proper death.
