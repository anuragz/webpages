<p class=title>Use of standard keywords while talking</p>
<p class=summary>When we try to explain somebody and the person is still not able to understand we can use a popular keyword that can be used to represent the idea  </p>
<p class=detail>Using keywords at right time is very important. If asked in interview, arrange 10 items in increasing order. I can say I'll find smaller numbers and place them before larger numbers and in last put all of them in sequence. The person can try to understand but if he does not know it he will not be able to use what is told to him. So he will ask for more details. Here you can simply say the type of sort like Quick sort you will be doing and he will understand it easily. You can add more important points later about how fast it can sort. Later if asked to explain how it works? simply explain the algorithm it works on.
